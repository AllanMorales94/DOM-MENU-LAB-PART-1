# DOM-MENU-LAB-PART-1
 This lab allowed me to practice DOM element selection, manipulation, and creation. It's the first part of a two-part menu bar lab with a slide-down submenu. While some tasks suit markup/CSS, the focus here is on JavaScript DOM manipulation. For static HTML/CSS, it's best to code directly in them to optimize efficiency and technology usage.
